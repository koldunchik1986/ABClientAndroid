## Problem

Character list is not displayed on the second launch of the application.

## Actions Taken

1.  **2025-10-04 09:47:48:** First launch of the application.
    *   `logcat.txt` shows `JS_CONSOLE: Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token -- From line 165 of http://neverlands.ru/ch/ch_list.js` and `JS_CONSOLE: Uncaught ReferenceError: chatlist_build is not defined -- From line 26 of http://neverlands.ru/ch.php?lo=1`.
    *   `Log_20251004_094748.txt` shows that `RoomManager.process` was called and the HTML was processed correctly.
2.  **2025-10-04 09:48:36:** Second launch of the application.
    *   `logcat2.txt` is clean.
    *   `Log_20251004_094836.txt` shows that `RoomManager.process` was **not** called.
3.  **2025-10-04 10:05:00:** Modified `MainActivity.java` to clear the WebView cache on startup.
4.  **2025-10-04 10:08:00:** Built and installed the application.
5.  **2025-10-04 10:10:00:** User reported that the issue persists.

## Hypothesis

The user suggests that the problem might be related to the user profile settings. On the first launch, the profile is clean and doesn't cause issues. On subsequent launches, the profile is loaded with settings that might interfere with the display of the character list.

## Next Steps

1.  Analyze the new `logcat.txt` and `logcat2.txt` files.
2.  Investigate the user's hypothesis.
3.  Formulate a new plan.
